========================================

Assignment explanation:

    The purpose of this assignment is to produce a 3D simulation of the Labyrinth game that is as realistic to the actual game as possible, yet still being a playable and an enjoyable experience for the end user.

    -Labyrinth

========================================

Dependencies:
    freeglut
    GLM
    assimp-utils
    libassimp-dev
    libassimp3
    libfreeimage3
    libfreeimage-dev
    libbullet-dev

========================================

Terminal commands in ''s

How to run:
    'Make' as normal
        For assimp2, type 'make DEFS=-DASSIMP_2'

    enter './../bin/Project' to execute from build folder

    No command-line input, just "./../bin/Project" after making. All needed files are loaded in on startup.

========================================

Bugs:

    There is a small problem with hitting Escape while a menu is up that I have yet to resolve, it ends erroring instead of exiting cleanly due to not being able to destroy a menu that is in use.
      It works fine, however, exiting by hitting the Quit menu object.
