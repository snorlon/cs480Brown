Terminal commands in ''s

How to run:
    'Make' as normal
    enter './../bin/Matrix' to execute from build folder

    For loading vertex shader from file, enter './../bin/Matrix -v filename'

    For loading fragment shader from file, enter './../bin/Matrix -f filename'

    For both shaders from file, enter './../bin/Matrix -f filename -v filename2' order does not matter
        All that matters is that file name follows the -f or -v command

    Example is shown in screenshot.png

    Entering custom vertex and fragment shaders is optional, and will use the pre-existing ones if they are not provided

    If you enter a bad filename, it will ignore it and move on.
    If the file name is good, it will say in the terminal that the corresponding shader has been loaded.
