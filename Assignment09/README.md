Bat control branch
==================

Controls
--------
Click and drag mouse button to control bat.<br>

Bugs
----
- Controls are still a little buggy. The bat jumps around if you unclick and then click the mouse again
- The model looks terrible for some reason
- The puck has no cap on velocity so if you hit it too hard it flies off the table. 

Other things
------------
If you want to test without waiting for the arcade machine to load in:
>$make DEFS=-DTESTING

*This also changes the zoom in/out from page up/down to F1/F2 because I don't have page up/down on my laptop, sorry*
